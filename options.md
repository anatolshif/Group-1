Excellent. Focusing on tools that solve pentester pain points is a smart approach. Here are a few more project options for you, all centered on automating a tedious or complex part of the web application penetration testing workflow.

### 1. Automated Exploit Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Generator

**The Problem:** Once a vulnerability is found, a pentester must manually craft a proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate the issue. This involves a lot of manual steps: copying requests, modifying parameters, and explaining the attack chain. This is repetitive and time-consuming.

**The Product:** A tool that takes the details of a web vulnerability and automatically generates a complete, runnable PoC. For example, if a SQL Injection vulnerability is found in a GET request, the tool could generate a `curl` command or a Python script that can be run to prove the existence of the vulnerability without any manual modification.

**Key Features:**
* **Vulnerability Input:** The user provides details of a vulnerability, such as the URL, vulnerable parameter, and payload.
* **PoC Generation:** The tool automatically creates a PoC in a few common formats (e.g., `curl` command, Python script using `requests`, or a simple URL with the payload embedded).
* **Code Customization:** The generated PoC code should be easily copyable and customizable.
* **Integrated Documentation:** The tool could even include a template to describe the PoC and its impact, which could then be used in the final report.

### 2. Client-Side Security Analyzer

**The Problem:** Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side JavaScript. Pentesters often overlook this, or manually review code, searching for sensitive data or misconfigurations. This can be very tedious and is prone to human error.

**The Product:** A tool that analyzes a web application's JavaScript files for common client-side vulnerabilities. This could be a static analysis tool that looks for patterns in the code.

**Key Features:**
* **Target Input:** The user provides a target URL. The tool then crawls the site and identifies all JavaScript files.
* **Static Analysis Engine:** The core of the tool would be a script that scans the JavaScript code for specific patterns, such as:
    * Hardcoded API keys, passwords, or other secrets.
    * Insecure use of `localStorage` to store sensitive data.
    * CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) misconfigurations.
    * Weak regular expressions that could be exploited.
* **Reporting:** The tool would provide a report listing all potential findings, the line of code where they were found, and a severity level.

### 3\. Vulnerability Documentation and Report Generator

The Problem: After a pentest is complete, the most time-consuming task is often writing the final report. This involves organizing screenshots, detailing proof-of-concept steps, and writing descriptive vulnerability summariesâ€”all of which is a manual process.



The Product: An application that helps a pentester document their findings throughout a test and then automatically generates a professional report. This tool transforms a pentester's rough notes into a polished deliverable.



Key Features:



Project-Based Interface: The tool is organized by project, with a dashboard showing a list of findings.



Vulnerability Templates: Each finding is logged using a structured template that includes fields for the vulnerability name, severity, affected component, proof-of-concept steps, and a remediation recommendation.



Evidence Storage: The ability to upload screenshots and code snippets for each vulnerability.



Automated Reporting: With the click of a button, the tool compiles all logged findings into a professional report (e.g., a PDF or Markdown document), saving hours of manual work.


### 1\. API Discovery and Documentation Tool

  * **The Problem:** Modern web applications heavily rely on APIs, many of which are not explicitly documented. Pentesters often struggle to find all API endpoints, especially for Single Page Applications (SPAs), making it easy to miss potential vulnerabilities.
  * **The Product:** A tool that intelligently crawls a web application and automatically discovers all API endpoints. It would analyze JavaScript files, network traffic (XHR requests), and common API naming conventions to build a comprehensive list of endpoints. It would then present this information in a clear, structured format, essentially generating documentation for an undocumented API.
  * **Key Features:**
      * **Automated Crawling:** Scans the target application and identifies all JavaScript files.
      * **Endpoint Extraction:** Parses JavaScript and monitors network traffic to extract all unique API endpoint URLs.
      * **Parameter Identification:** Attempts to identify the parameters required by each endpoint.
      * **Structured Output:** Generates a clean output (e.g., Markdown or JSON) that documents the discovered APIs.

### 2\. Content Security Policy (CSP) Analyzer

  * **The Problem:** Manually analyzing a web application's Content Security Policy (CSP) to find misconfigurations or potential bypasses is a complex, expert-level task. A small error in a CSP can lead to a bypass for XSS, but it's often difficult to spot.
  * **The Product:** A tool that takes a website's URL, retrieves its CSP, and analyzes the policy for known bypass techniques and weak configurations. It would provide a report on potential security flaws in the policy itself, helping pentesters identify opportunities for attack.
  * **Key Features:**
      * **Policy Fetching:** Automatically retrieves the `Content-Security-Policy` header from the target URL.
      * **Syntax Checking:** Validates the CSP syntax and flags any errors.
      * **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies common misconfigurations like overly broad wildcards (`'self' *`), or a non-existent `default-src` directive that could be exploited.
      * **Bypass Suggestions:** Suggests specific payloads or techniques that could bypass the detected weaknesses.

### 1\. Automated SSL Pinning Bypass Generator

  * **The Problem:** Many mobile applications use SSL pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Bypassing this security control is a mandatory first step for a pentester to intercept and analyze network traffic. The manual process of writing and injecting custom Frida scripts for each app is tedious and repetitive.
  * **The Product:** A command-line tool that automates the process of generating a Frida script to bypass SSL pinning. The user would simply provide the target app's package name, and the tool would generate a suitable script that could then be attached to the running process.
  * **Key Features:**
      * **Framework Detection:** The tool could attempt to detect the framework used for network requests (e.g., OkHttp, AFNetworking, etc.) to generate a more targeted script.
      * **Script Generation:** Provides a template and fills in the necessary details to create a robust Frida script.
      * **One-Click Injection:** Optionally, the tool could even automate the process of attaching the generated script to the app.

### 2\. Local Data Extractor and Analyzer

  * **The Problem:** A key part of mobile app security testing is checking what sensitive data is stored on the device itself. Manually locating and inspecting files in various local storage locations (e.g., `SharedPreferences`, `SQLite` databases, log files) on a rooted device is a time-consuming and often chaotic process.
  * **The Product:** A tool that connects to a rooted Android or jailbroken iOS device, automatically enumerates all local storage locations for a given app, extracts the data, and presents it in a human-readable format.
  * **Key Features:**
      * **Device Connection:** Connects to the mobile device via ADB or SSH.
      * **Automatic Discovery:** Finds and lists all local data files for the target app.
      * **Data Extraction & Parsing:** Extracts data from common file types like XML (for `SharedPreferences`) and SQLite databases, and displays it in a structured way.
      * **Sensitive Data Highlighting:** A feature that highlights patterns of potentially sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal information).
